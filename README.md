Hi! My name is Shijian Liu (pronouces as Shee-Jane Leo). I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Marketing at NYU Stern School of Business . Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Economics from Peking University, and my master's degree in Economics and Computation from Duke University. I am interested in Industrial Organization, Quantitative Marketing, and Causal Inference Methodology.

I am a main contributor to the following causal inference packages:
* [fect_stata](https://github.com/xuyiqing/fect_stata) : STATA package for implementing counterfactual estimators in panel fixed-effect settings.
* [fect_python](https://github.com/xuyiqing/fect_python) : Python package for implementing counterfactual estimators in panel fixed-effect settings.
* [DeepSynth](https://github.com/yhzhu99/DeepSynth): Upcoming

In my spare time, I am interested in learning nature history and Kendo (classic Japanese Fencing).
