Hi! My name is Shijian (Andrew) Liu. I am a second-year graduate student in the Master of Economics and Computation (MSEC) program at Duke University. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Economics from Peking University. I am interested in Applied Econometrics, Empirical Industrial Organization, and Quantitative Marketing.
I am a main contributor to the following causal inference packages:
* [fect_stata](https://github.com/xuyiqing/fect_stata) : STATA package for implementing counterfactual estimators in panel fixed-effect settings.
* [fect_python](https://github.com/xuyiqing/fect_python) : Python package for implementing counterfactual estimators in panel fixed-effect settings.
